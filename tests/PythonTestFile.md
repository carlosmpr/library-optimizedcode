  # PythonTestFile.py
  # Explanation of Shortest Path Finding Algorithm using Dijkstra's Algorithm

The provided code implements a graph data structure and a method to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Graph Class
- The `Graph` class represents a graph data structure.
- **Attributes**:
  - `nodes`: A dictionary to store nodes and their neighbors along with the edge weights.

### `add_node` Method
- **Parameters**:
  - `label`: The label of the node being added.
  - `neighbors`: A list of tuples where each tuple contains a neighbor node and the edge weight to that neighbor.
- **Functionality**:
  - Adds a node to the graph with its neighbors and edge weights.

### `shortest_path` Method
- **Parameters**:
  - `start`: The starting node for finding the shortest path.
  - `end`: The destination node for finding the shortest path.
- **Functionality**:
  - Finds the shortest path from the `start` node to the `end` node using Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - Initializes necessary data structures like `queue`, `distances`, `previous`, and `visited`.
  - Utilizes a priority queue (`heapq`) to efficiently explore nodes based on their current cost.
  - Updates the shortest distances and previous nodes as it explores the graph.
  - Finally, reconstructs and returns the shortest path from `start` to `end`.

### Example Usage
- The code creates a graph with nodes A to F and their respective neighbors and edge weights.
- It then finds and prints the shortest path from node A to node F.

### External Libraries
- The code uses the `heapq` module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm. It is used here to maintain the priority queue for efficient node exploration in Dijkstra's algorithm.

This code snippet demonstrates a simple implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  import heapq

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}

    def add_node(self, label, neighbors):
        self.nodes[label] = neighbors

    def shortest_path(self, start, end):
        queue = [(0, start)]
        distances = {node: float('inf') for node in self.nodes}
        distances[start] = 0
        previous = {node: None for node in self.nodes}
        visited = set()

        while queue:
            current_cost, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)

            if current_node in visited:
                continue

            visited.add(current_node)

            for neighbor, cost in self.nodes[current_node]:
                if neighbor in visited:
                    continue

                new_cost = current_cost + cost
                if new_cost < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = new_cost
                    previous[neighbor] = current_node
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, neighbor))

        path = []
        at = end
        while at is not None:
            path.append(at)
            at = previous[at]

        return path[::-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = Graph()
    graph.add_node("A", [("B", 4), ("C", 2)])
    graph.add_node("B", [("A", 4), ("C", 1), ("D", 5)])
    graph.add_node("C", [("A", 2), ("B", 1), ("D", 8), ("E", 10)])
    graph.add_node("D", [("B", 5), ("C", 8), ("E", 2), ("F", 6)])
    graph.add_node("E", [("C", 10), ("D", 2), ("F", 3)])
    graph.add_node("F", [("D", 6), ("E", 3)])

    print("Shortest path from A to F:", graph.shortest_path("A", "F"))
  ```
